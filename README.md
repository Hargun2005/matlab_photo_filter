## üñºÔ∏è Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive image processing project featuring the implementation of seven unique filters in MATLAB. The core objective was to explore digital image manipulation at the pixel level, avoiding high-level toolboxes for the main filter logic.

### The Filters

-   **`Greyscale`**: Converts a color image to its luminance values.
-   **`Invert`**: Inverts the colors of an image for a negative effect.
-   **`Blur`**: Applies a custom box blur to soften the image.
-   **`Sketch`**: Artistically combines the above filters to create a hand-drawn look.
-   **`Two-Tone`**: Reduces an image to two user-specified colors, creating high-contrast art.
-   **`FindClosestColor`**: A helper function to map a pixel to its nearest color in a palette.
-   **`Crystallise`**: Generates a mosaic effect by segmenting the image and averaging colors within regions.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of MATLAB's array operations, algorithmic thinking, and modular code design.
